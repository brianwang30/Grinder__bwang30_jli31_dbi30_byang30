P01: Grass-O-Meter

Propo: Our proposal is a website that will use information provided by the user about experience in various games and franchises to determine how grass deprived the user is. Our code will utilize provided usernames to find information on how sweaty the user is in select games through provided game APIs. We will also provide quizzes to find out how far past too much information the user knows about a franchise through testing information gathered from the respective API. All of this will be presented in a Bootstrap website, with a number of grass blades touched by the user.
